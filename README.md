## OpenGL Graphics Rendering

This is a simple OpenGL project demonstrating how to render various shapes using the OpenGL graphics library.

**Getting Started:**

1. **Prerequisites:**
    * You'll need the following development libraries installed:
        * **cmake && make:** Generate and build Makefiles. (CMake documentation: `https://cmake.org/documentation/`)
        * **mesa-libGL-devel:** Provides the OpenGL development libraries.
        * **glfw-devel:** Provides the GLFW development libraries for creating windows and handling user input.
2. **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/eddiecode100/opengl_graphics_rendering.git
    ```
3. **Build the Project:**
   The build process might vary depending on your system and development environment. Here's a general guideline:
    * Navigate to the project directory.
    * Run CMake to generate the build files:
        ```bash
        cmake .
        ```
    * Build the project using the appropriate command based on the generated build system (e.g., `make` for Makefiles).

**Running the Project:**

Once the project is built, you should have an executable file (e.g., `my_opengl_project`). Run it from the command line:

```bash
./my_opengl_project
```
